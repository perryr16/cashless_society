SHOULD PROBABLY READ THIS, got distracted by facebook money

- known to the blockchain community since in 2014 but relatively a steath movement
- CBDC - central bank digial currency
- PBOC digital currency (Peoples bank of china)
- PBOC DCEP (digital currency/ electronic payment)
- being tested in 4 cities
- franchises like McDonals, Subway, and Starbucks are part of the test group
- major chinese banks are deploying test wallets 
- pending a success, e-comerce giants DiDi Chuxing and Meituan-Dianping will adopt the new currency who have a combined consuer base over 1 billion
- next would be Huawei, Alipay, and WeChat Pay
- many details shrouded in secrecy ... its china...

Its not Crypto
- no one is calling it a crypto currency
- PBOC has total control - rate of production, visbility into every transaction. CRUD functionality - see it, retrieve it, destroy it...
- peope are unlikely to have a choice - 1.4 billion people in china
- could absorb platforms like WeChat Pay. holdings in those platforms could be conveted to PBOC DCEP

PROS
- Transactions will be faster and more seamless

CONS
- some companies use china based platforms like WeChat to do business. This is a tax loop hole. China sees it, but the canadian govt wont.
- which govt is willing to allow dirty deeds. 
  - if a illegal purchase is made on American soil with chinese money than the US govt knows nothing, while the chinese govt is aware and likely unwilling to share that info with the USA

OTHER
- aims to knock american curreny off as leading financial currency
- HUGE power comes with ownership of the leading currency
- because of chinas strict regulation it may be unattractive to global businesses
- China could force smaller economies to accept DCEP in exchange for belt and road infrastructure (Laos, Cambodia)
- larger contries are likely unwilling to let chinese software flood their financial institutions

DOMESTIC CONTROL
- similar to facial recognition, this will take govt visibility into domestic economy to a new level
- no need to ask questions, records are all visibile all the time
- Shadow banks and Shadow economies will be no more - or more difficult to run - USD, gold ...

- REGULATORS LOVE THE VISIBILTIY
- PRIVACY ADVOCATES WILL HATE IT
