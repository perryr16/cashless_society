- new coin called Libra
- stablecoin
- facebook has built a blockchain to support libra
- intends for it to replace paper money and credit cards. Use money directly from the app
- can transfer money to friends similar to venmo, pay merchants
- replacement for cash in underbanked areas
- want libra to function for migrant workers, unbanked populations
- can keep funds safe and accessible
- who will oversee its management?
- backed by several currecnies
- intended to act as digital cash than the tradniiotnal speculative function of crypto currencies
  - easier to transact, faster throughput with quicker validation

ITS DIFFERENT
- blockchain without blocks or chain
- relyies on validators with permissioned access rather than nodes
- “There is no concept of a block of transactions in the ledger history,”
- validator network is made up of companies
  - ex: visa, mastercard, paypal, ebay. Each donated 10 million to libra's development
- based on a new language MOVE (used for smart contracts)
- hope to have libra backed by cash
- facebook wont get a cut through transactions, but its likely libra association could earn big divedends
- smaller the transaction, the faster it should go through
- “What Facebook, or any company like Facebook, is proposing is not a cryptocurrency. It doesn’t have any of the fundamental characteristics of cryptocurrency. It doesn’t stand on the five pillars of an open blockchain. These are open, public, neutral, censorship-resistant, and borderless. Facebook has left true decentralization by the wayside in exchange for broader industry appeal.”
- belief that it will lower foreign exchange cost and smoother cross-border trading
- built for mass appeal
- large user base is essential to its success
