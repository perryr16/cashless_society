Benefits of economic growth have been unevenly shared
Low level of trust for corrupt governments and institutions harm economic development.
Crypto could provide benefit by overcoming the lack of trust and increasing access to financial services. Increasing financial inclusion. Better traceability of funds
Bitcoin (189 Billion) and Ethereum (18 Billion)
Accountability and transparency - although you gotta trust the underlying algorithm
Govt cant manage a crypto currency
World wide trade - inclusive to all (with appropriate tech)
Transfers are cheap
Small money transfer is easy
Faster
Easy to pay for illegal activities
Pseudonymous 
High price volatility makes it hard to store your money
Just need the internet
Because Govt looses power and you can pay for illegal goods some countries have outlawed it (indonesia) 
Financial inclusion is essential for the development of a country.
Financial services allow people to protect against situations of financial shortage.
If you don’t have a bank account you can’t participate in many global transactions/world wide trade.
Countries get stuck in social trust traps
People need access to the internet. Thankfully access to the internet in dev countries has rapidly increased
We need a liquid market for bitcoin
BitPesa in Kenya
Facilitate small scale international trade
Money transactions are expensive and can be discouraging. Opens up international financing
Microfinancing
Anti-corruption. Monitor how state funds are used
HEAVILY DEPENDANT on world wide adoption of crypto currencies. Price volatility is a problem
Stability could be reached through regulation and political support - but this reduces the appeal of crypto currencies
