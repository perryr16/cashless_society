### SWEDEN – THE FIRST CASHLESS SOCIETY?
https://sweden.se/business/cashless-society/

* About 80 per cent of Swedes use a card to pay for purchases. Digital payments via card or apps are so widely accepted that many Swedes no longer carry cash. Even children pay with debit cards.

* Every two years, Sweden’s central bank, Riksbanken, carries out a survey on payments patterns in Sweden. Between 2016 and 2018 card payments increased by 25 per cent, at the expense of cash payments.

* Swedes mainly use debit cards (PIN usually required, unlike in many countries) and our new favourite mobile payment app, Swish. So many people are ‘swishing’ now that the app is credited for the reduction of cash circulating in Sweden, according to a study by KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

* Some vendors are not happy with the change because of an increase in transaction fees
  * also older people have trouble adapting
